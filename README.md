Software Development Systems - AE2 - Basic foundation of a JavaFX user management application

An application programmed using Java and consisting of JavaFX user interfaces. This application was programmed as part of an assignment
project within the "Software Development Systems" module. The project was meant to be produced as part of a 4 person team however due to
unforseen circumstances the project was developed solely by myself. The overall aim of the project was to produce an application that could
add and manipulate users, games, systems and platforms and link this information together.

Due to this beeing a solo project instead of a group project some features are incomplete.
